Tomorrow I will still be unhappy.
I'm still not happy.
I'm not happy.
I'm still not happy.
I want to be happy forever, but today, I'm dealing with depression.

He was stabbed, but he's not okay.
Even though he was stabbed, he got injured.
How difficult it is to open up to new people after going through the experience of being stabbed with an electric saw, an ax, a handsaw, a butt stroke, a taser, a pocketknife, and an embroidery scissors in the back. It's a huge lie from this fraud... Bolsonaro's stabbing, this thief said it was fake, this lie is faker than anything, someone in horrible pain wouldn't wait to go sightseeing and plunder the Brazilian people with their extravagant expenses like a king. It's a huge lie from this fraud... Bolsonaro's stabbing, this thief said it was fake, this lie is faker than anything, someone in horrible pain wouldn't wait to go sightseeing and plunder the Brazilian people.
He was stabbed.
I hate Brazil. Shitty country.
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
Would not recommend to others.
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
Not my thing.
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
Never had anything to complain about here.
It was way over fried.
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
Will not be back!
The price is reasonable and the service is great.
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
But the service was beyond bad.
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
Don't bother coming here.
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
This place is horrible and way overpriced.
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
The service here is fair at best.
Mediocre food.
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
The food wasn't good.
I was VERY disappointed!!
This place is disgusting!
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
The RI style calamari was a joke.
Unfortunately, it was not good.
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
The service was extremely slow.
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
The ambiance isn't much better.
Unfortunately, we won't be going back.
This place lacked style!!
It was equally awful.
The food was terrible.
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
Food was below average.
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
The real disappointment was our waiter.
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
Spend your money and time some place else.
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
the presentation of the food was awful.
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Appetite instantly gone.
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
